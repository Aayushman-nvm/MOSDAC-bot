# MOSDAC BOT
For BAH 2025

## What's Made
- Built a functional and practical RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application.
- Uses static retrieval (keyword-based) instead of vector-based semantic retrieval.

## What's in Making
- Add vector database retrieval.
- Implement embedding-based similarity search.
- Add citation mapping in responses.
- Save previous chats in MongoDB tied to session ID.
- Improve query quality using rephrasing techniques.
- Combine embeddings with filtering for better context injection.
