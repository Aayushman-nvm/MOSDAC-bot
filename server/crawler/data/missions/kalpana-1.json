      "content": "<p>Metsat is an exclusive meteorological satellite of ISRO in geo-synchronous orbit. This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.</p>\n<p>Metsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.</p>"

      "content": "<p><span>K</span>alpana-1 is the first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by Indian Space Research Organisation using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle on 2002-09-12. This was the first satellite launched by the PSLV into the Geo-stationary orbit. The satellite was originally known as MetSat-1. On February 5, 2003 it was renamed to Kalpana-1 by the Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in memory of Kalpana Chawla?a NASA astronaut who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.</p>\n<p>The satellite features a Very High Resolution scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) payload.</p>\n<p>So far, meteorological services had been combined with telecommunication and television services in the INSAT series. MetSat-1 is a precursor to the future INSAT system that will have separate satellites for meteorology and telecommunication &amp; broadcasting services.</p>"

      "content": "<p><span>T</span>he MetSat-1 spacecraft was developed by ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), Bangalore. MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle.</p>\n<p>Structural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components.</p>\n<p>MetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control).</p>\n<p>The propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters.</p>\n<p>EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized.</p>\n<p>The spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.</p>"

      "content": "<p style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: #0f3393; font-weight: bold;\">VHRR</p>\n<p><span>V</span>HRR/2 is a modified version of the VHRR heritage imagers flown on INSAT-2A, -2B, and -2E. The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full frame mode (20° North-South x 20° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk</li>\n<li>Normal frame mode (14° N-S x 20° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes</li>\n<li>Sector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5° N-S x 20° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: #0f3393; font-weight: bold;\">Imaging modes of the VHRR instrument</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Imaging mode</th>\n<th>Coverage</th>\n<th>Repeatability</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Full scan</td>\n<td>20° N-S and 20° E-W</td>\n<td>33 min</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal scan</td>\n<td>14° N-S and 20° E-W</td>\n<td>23 min</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sector scan</td>\n<td>4.5° N-S and 20° E-W</td>\n<td>23 (3 times)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: #0f3393; font-weight: bold;\">Imaging modes of the VHRR instruments</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Channel</th>\n<th>No of detectors</th>\n<th>MTF (Modulation Transfer Function)</th>\n<th>Dynamic range</th>\n<th>Noise performance</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>VIS</td>\n<td>4 +4 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.23 approx.</td>\n<td>0-100% albedo</td>\n<td>6 : 1 min at 2.5% albedo</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Water Vapor (WV)</td>\n<td>1 + 1 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.21 approx.</td>\n<td>4-340 K</td>\n<td>0.25 K at 300 K</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TIR</td>\n<td>1 + 1 redundant</td>\n<td>&gt; 0.21 approx.</td>\n<td>4-320 K</td>\n<td>0.5 K at 300 K</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: #0f3393; font-weight: bold;\">Schematic illustration of the VHRR instrument</p>\n<p><img id=\"center-img\" src=\"/images/vhrr_imaging_modes.JPG\" alt=\"\" align=\"middle\"></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: #0f3393; font-weight: bold;\">VHRR Instrument</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spectral band: VIS<br> Spectral band: TIR<br> Spectral band: MWIR (Water vapor)</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">0.55 - 0.75 µm; Integrated out-of-band response &lt;3% <br> Inter detector mismatch &lt; 5% 10.5 - 12.5 µm; Integrated out-of-band response &lt;3%<br> Out-of-band response peak &lt; 0.1% 5.7 - 7.1 µm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spatial resolution VIS <br> Spatial resolution TIR and MWIR</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">56 µrad (or 2 km x 2 km)<br> 224 µrad (or 8 km x 8 km)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Radiometric performance: SNR<br> Radiometric performance: NEDT</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&gt; 6 for VIS at 2.5% albedo<br> &lt; 0.25 K at 300 K for IR channel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dynamic range of TIR/MWIR channels<br> Dynamic range of VIS channel</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">4-340 K<br> 0-100%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Misregistration between VIS and IR</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&lt;56 µrad</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&gt; 21% for IR and TIR; &gt;23% for VIS channel</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0f3393; font-size: 1.3em; font-weight: bold;\">DRT (Data Relay Transponder)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">The DRT (Data Relay Transponder) is part of a DCS (Data Collection System) of ISRO.
